# TopScorers
A short coding challenge

## Assumptions made
1. Input text/csv "Score" column has only numbers, error handling wasn't implemented for this case.
2. The text/csv file has delimeter ','. This can be improved in the future for user to choose delimeter but wasn't part of this challenge
3. There are no empty "cells", this assumption is similar to 1.
4. If there is data in the file, there will always be a top scorer, even if there is one person.
